Utils for the OPENi Cloudlet Platform

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install git+ssh://git@gitlab.openi-ict.eu:openi-cloudlet-utils.git`

To build the project enter the following commands.

Note: npm install is only required the first time the module is built or if a new dependency is added. There are a number of grunt tasks that can be executed including: test, cover, default and jenkins. The jenkins task is executed on the build server, if it doesn't pass then the build will fail.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.openi-ict.eu:openi-cloudlet-utils.git

npm install
grunt jenkins
